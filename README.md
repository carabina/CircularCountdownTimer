# Countdown-Timer-View-Swift
A UIView / NSView subclass which displays a circular countdown timer.  

Notet that the original purpose of the timer was to work with one time password generation,this is why the timer is aligned with actual time (as calulated from the UNIX epoch). A 60 second timer started at 06:20:23 will show 38 seconds remaning and complete at exactly 06:21:00.  A 10 second timer started at 09:01:45 will show 5 seconds remaining and complete at exactly 09:01:50.
